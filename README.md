# Robust and Reproducible AI: Statistical Foundations for Machine Learning in Medical Imaging

Tutorial materials for the IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics (BHI'25), October 2025.

## Overview
- **Instructors:** Ernest (Khashayar) Namdar & Pascal N. Tyrrell  
- **Goal:** Provide practitioners with reproducible workflows and statistical foundations for building trustworthy machine learning systems in medical imaging.  
- **Focus areas:** dataset curation, model validation, uncertainty quantification, and transparent reporting.

## Repository Layout
- `Part1-Classification/` — hands-on notebooks and scripts for classification pipelines.  
- `Part2-Segmentation/` — hands-on notebooks and scripts for segmentation pipelines.  
- `Part3-Regression/` — hands-on notebooks and scripts for regression pipelines.  
- `Presentation/` — slide decks and figures used during the tutorial.  
- `LICENSE` — MIT License for the tutorial assets.
